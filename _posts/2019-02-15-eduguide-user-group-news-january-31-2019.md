<h1>EduGuide User Group</h1>
<h2>News</h2>
<p><b>January 31, 2019</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>It’s a frigid Thursday morning as I sit down to write this summary of the many changes that are coming to EduGuide’s website. I hope to reach out often with similar summaries in the future. This will also be a chance to answer common questions, give sneak peaks of upcoming features, and in general do anything I can to help coaches succeed on the site.</p>
<h2>Recent Updates</h2>
<p>We’ve made a number of cosmetic improvements to the Path system over the last couple of months. Each activity now begins with an image which persists in the background, and reappears with more information towards the end of the activity. Both Coaches and Students are now able to respond to comments from inside their path journal.</p>
<h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
<p>We have been working on functionality which will make it possible to deliver polls and surveys within the path activities. Responses to these poll questions will also be displayed inside a separate section on the path journal and metrics pages. This means that as coaches review students’ progress in the path, they will be able to specifically view their response to poll questions. Path participants can view their own poll responses inside their path journal.</p>
<h2>Focus: IT Testing</h2>
<p>IT Testing is a big part of the procedure schools follow when they launch or relaunch a team. Coaches are prompted to send IT testing requests when they complete the team setup page. EduGuide uses this testing to ensure schools have set up their networks so that students are able to access EduGuide’s website, and to screen for any potential technical issues that might occur while students are working on their paths.</p>
<p>Ideally, a network technician would complete the testing. They are shown a series of screens which direct them to make changes to their network’s firewall, whitelist emails from EduGuide, and complete a brief, test path which hits upon the different types of steps that are commonly presented in the Core Learning path.</p>
<p>Testers conclude the test by stating whether it passed or failed. A response of “failed” prompts follow up from EduGuide.</p>
<p>Coaches are able to track the progress of the testing from the Team Setup page. Notations next to a tester’s name will state whether the test is pending, or if it has passed or failed.</p>
<p>The following <a href="http://eduguide.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/3000085365-complete-the-it-testing-process">video describes the IT Testing process in greater detail</a>.</p>
