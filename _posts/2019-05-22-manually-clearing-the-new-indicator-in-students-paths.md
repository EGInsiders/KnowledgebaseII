The system identifies students with unseen comments by displaying the word “New” next to a student name, and next to the activity question where the new comment has been posted. Typically, the new indicators will clear as you scroll through a student’s activity history.

You can also use a command to clear the “New” indicator manually.
<ol>
 	<li>Navigate to the Metrics page for your team</li>
 	<li>Click on the menu icon next the student who has a “New” indicator that you would like to clear</li>
 	<li>A message will appear, confirming your request. Click “Ok.”</li>
 	<li>The system will confirm that any new comments have now had the “New” indicator removed.</li>
</ol>

If the “New” continues to show in the Metrics page, clicking refresh will clear it. Or, it will not be visible when you revisit the page.
