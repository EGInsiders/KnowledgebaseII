<h2>## Feedback</h2>
At the end of each activity in the Core Learning Path, Team Coaches have a chance to offer a reaction or suggestion to the activity. This provides a chance to reflect upon what was learned, how it is applied and gives everyone a chance to share ways improvements can be made to the Core Learning Path or the EduGuide platform for stronger implementation.

<h2>## Notifications</h2>
<h2>VO:</h2>
EduGuide keeps its coaches updated on student progress and other events via a series of email notifications. Among them are the daily and weekly path progress reports.

Daily email updates are sent to coaches assigned to follow a group. Weekly updates show who is engaging in the activities online. Weekly email updates, give coaches a rundown of what all groups on the team have done for the week. Coaches can opt out of these progress reports by adjusting their notifications settings in their “My Settings” page.

Students are alerted via email each time that a coach responds to their comment in a path activity. Students can respond by email, or log into the site and then respond to their coach via their Path Journal.
