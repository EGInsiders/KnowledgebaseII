<h1>The Groups Feature</h1>
<p>On EduGuide’s website, Groups is a feature which can be used to keep teams organized. From the groups management page, you can create a new group, look up a group join code, and manually add students to a group. There is a function called Auto Groups which will automatically create new groups for Lead Coaches as they join the team.</p>
<p>When a student is added to a group, they become a member of that group. Coaches are added as followers, because they will be following the progress of the students in that group via the Metrics page and the emailed reports.</p>
<h2>Groups and Filtering</h2>
<p>The groups that you follow as a coach will be displayed in the group filter on the Metrics page. The default filter is “My Group Members,” which generates a list showing all of the students from the groups that you’ve followed. You can also select a specific group. Click “Show archived” to view students who have been archived.</p>

<p> The groups filter can also be used in conjunction with the View All Replies function. You can view all of the replies students have submitted for a given step by clicking on “View All Replies.” You can fine tune the list of responses by selecting a group from the filter control.</p>

<p>We are currently in the process of documenting the group feature, and I am wondering if there are any aspects of this feature that deserve special attention. If you have questions about groups, the group management page, or anything I’ve mentioned here, please contact me at jon@eduguide.org.</p>
